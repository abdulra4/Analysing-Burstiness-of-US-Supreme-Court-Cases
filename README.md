# Analysing-Burstiness-of-US-Supreme-Court-Topics

I analyse the dynamics of editorial wars in U.S. Supreme Court articles on Wikipedia (WP) using the concept of Burstiness (B). The question I focus on is whether the characteristics of a case cited in the WP article about the case or in an article which the case is key affects the B of the article. The concept of B is not new and has been used to model many systems to determine the extent to which events are random. I use the B measure as a proxy for editorial wars rather than total edits and editors because each article has existed for various periods so comparing sums does not give an accurate depiction of the dynamics of edits. By using the bursty measure we can compare like-with-like using the distribution of the edits for each article.
